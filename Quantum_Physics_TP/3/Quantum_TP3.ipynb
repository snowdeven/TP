The dispersion is clearly visible before time $t=2 \\ u.a.$, the wave packet spreads out in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be understood with the uncertainty principle $\\sigma_x \\sigma_p = \\hbar/2$ at the beginning the wave packet is well localized in terms of position and after the wave packet starts to spread in the box so the uncertainty on the position increases with the time until $t = 16 u.a.$ where the uncertainty on the position seems to be returned to the initial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the packet is not spreading uniformly in the box and form this pattern is because of the box edges which are infinite potential walls at $x = 0 \\ u.a.$ and $x = 20 \\ u.a.$, so when the fastest plane wave of the wave packet meet theses wall and get reflected on it, this changes its direction. When the reflected fastest wave meet the slowest, the Gaussian's wave packet interfers with itself. Thus, we observe destructive interferences in the dark area and constructive ones in the colored area."

    "On this graph we have $ 3 x 4 $ subplot, respectively corresponding to the values of $p$, and to the values of $\\tau$. We can clearly see the shape of the barrier changing with the values of $\\tau$, the lowest $\\tau$ is, the faster the barrier will oscillate between its minimum and its maximum width. The influence of the $p$ parameter is as we expected for $p=3$, we have three \"probability beams\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For $p=1$ we can see the meeting between $\\psi$ and the potential bar because of the deformation of $\\psi$, when it's deforming we have self-interference which causes a reduced probability to find the particle or an increased probability to find it. In this case we can see that $\\psi$ keeps an approximate global shape with interferences but we don't loose all the information of our probability especially for the big values of $\\tau$. Indedd, $\\psi$ is just like compressed a little bit and this causes the probability to be increased in the middle of the rest of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $p=2$ we can see for small $\\tau$ that interferences occur and we loose a consequent amount of information our system. For high values of $\\tau$, the two \"beams\" are pushed to the other side of the box. One thus sees like interferences between the two \"beams\" causing an increasing probability to find the particle in the yellow area. \n",
    "For $p=3$ we can see that for small values of $\\tau$, we loose almost all the information on $\\psi$ and we witness the chaos in the rest of the box, for high values of $\\tau$, we have a more stable system with our three \"beams\" like crunching in the rest of the box and a spike of higher probability to find the particle but compared to the two previous cases, we loose more information on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the potential barrier at certain moment we still have some red points which normally indicate that the probability to find the particle is not negligible but we think this is a \"bug\" of accuracy of our simulation because the potential barrier is very high and when we increase the number of points ($ N_{TIME}$ and $N_{STEP}$), we reduce the number of red points but we can't increase enough the accuracy on our graph to remove all the red points."

    "In this practical work we have seen three interesting systems by propagating the wave function with or without time-dependent potentials :\n",
    "\n",
    "- the first system was the propagation of a wave packet in a box, we have seen the so called Quantum Carpet, this result enlighted the nature of the wave packet by demonstrating self-interference of $\\psi$. It was due to the fact the wave packet is an infinite sum of plane waves with different momenta and this is why we could observe a dispersion phenomenon with the wave packet and not with the wave function (3rd system). We have seen the quantum packet revival which reflects an important difference between stationary waves in quantum physics and rest in classical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second system has reinforced what we showed and concluded in the first one by showing the intrinsic nature of quantum physics, which is an undeterministic theory.\n",
    "With this potential barrier we have seen even if the moment is not enough high we see the particle has still a probability to pass trough it by tunnel effect and reciprocaly even with a higher momentum the particle still have a probability to reflect on the potential barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The last system showed how a particle behaves with a fluctuating potential barrier. Indeed, this potential barrier accelerates the probability distribution cycle (patterns getting smaller) of the particle while reducing the space in which it can be found, and this is why it is called a quantum Fermi accelerator. The higher $\\tau$ is, the less the distribution is accelerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these three systems and the two previous practical works, we have seen several methods to numerically integrate the Schrödinger's equation, how to represent infinite dimensional systems, and here we combined the two first best methods to build up the so called variant of split operator. We thus propagated a particle in a box and studied the behavior of $\\psi$ in presence of a potential barrier or not and what we can do after studying the influence of these objects."
